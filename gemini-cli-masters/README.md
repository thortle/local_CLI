# Gemini Masters CLI

![Gemini Masters CLI Screenshot](./docs/assets/gemini-screenshot.png)

This repository contains the Gemini Masters CLI, a command-line AI workflow tool that connects to your
tools, understands your code and accelerates your workflows. This is a fork of the original Gemini CLI
from Google developed by the AI Masters Pro Community at skool.com.

With the Original Gemini CLI you can:

- Query and edit large codebases in and beyond Gemini's 1M token context window.
- Generate new apps from PDFs or sketches, using Gemini's multimodal capabilities.
- Automate operational tasks, like querying pull requests or handling complex rebases.
- Use tools and MCP servers to connect new capabilities, including [media generation with Imagen,
  Veo or Lyria](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-creative-studio/tree/main/experiments/mcp-genmedia)
- Ground your queries with the [Google Search](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/grounding)
  tool, built in to Gemini.

Additions Include:

-- Support for Azure OpenAI
-- OpenAI Compatible Models Including GPT-4o
-- Anthropic Claude Models
-- Local LLM (Ollama)

-- Ability to change models on the fly.
-- /plan to enter plan mode.
-- /model (local, claude, openai) to change models
-- /auth - Extentions to the /auth function for configuration.

-- When using local models they must support tools and must already be downloaded.

## Quickstart

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have [Node.js version 20](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or higher installed.
2. **Run the CLI:** Execute the following command in your terminal:

   install it with:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @ai-masters-community/gemini-cli-masters-core@latest @ai-masters-community/gemini-cli-masters@latest
   gemini-masters
   ```

3. **Pick a color theme**
4. **Authenticate:** When prompted, sign in with your personal Google account. This will grant you up to 60 model requests per minute and 1,000 model requests per day using Gemini.

You are now ready to use the Gemini CLI!

### Use a Gemini API key:

The Gemini API provides a free tier with [100 requests per day](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits#free-tier) using Gemini 2.5 Pro, control over which model you use, and access to higher rate limits (with a paid plan):

1. Generate a key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).
2. Set it as an environment variable in your terminal. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your generated key.

   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
   ```

3. (Optionally) Upgrade your Gemini API project to a paid plan on the API key page (will automatically unlock [Tier 1 rate limits](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits#tier-1))

For other authentication methods, including Google Workspace accounts, see the [authentication](./docs/cli/authentication.md) guide.

## Examples

Once the CLI is running, you can start interacting with Gemini from your shell.

You can start a project from a new directory:

```sh
cd new-project/
gemini-masters
> Write me a Gemini Discord bot that answers questions using a FAQ.md file I will provide
```

Or work with an existing project:

```sh
git clone https://git.kineticseas.com/AIMastersCommunity/Gemini-Masters-CLI.git
cd Gemini-Masters-CLI
gemini-masters
> Give me a summary of all of the changes that went in yesterday
```
