# Future Features - Agent Development Planning

**Created**: October 1, 2025  
**Status**: Planning phase - Research required before implementation  
**Purpose**: Roadmap for transforming CLI into a fully autonomous agentic system

- 🛠️ Enhanced tool ecosystem beyond current 30+ tools
- 🌐 MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration
- 🧠 Persistent memory and learning
- 🕷️ Autonomous web crawling and research
- 📚 RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for knowledge base
- 🤖 Multi-step autonomous task orchestration

## 📊 Current State (Baseline)

### ✅ What's Already Working

**LM Studio Integration**: Complete and functional
- AuthType.USE_LM_STUDIO implemented
- Model switching with `/model lmstudio`
- Tool calling: 90-100% success rate
- Performance: 2-4 second responses

**Tool Ecosystem**: 30+ built-in tools
- **File Operations** (5): read-file, write-file, edit, ls, read-many-files
- **Search & Discovery** (3): grep, glob, file-discovery
- **Development** (4): shell, git, web-fetch, web-search
- **Advanced** (4): memoryTool, mcp-client, mcp-tool, tool-registry
- **Additional** (14+): modifiable-tool, diffOptions, etc.

**Infrastructure**: Production-ready
- MCP SDK installed (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.11.0`)
- Tool registry system for dynamic tool loading
- Memory system (memoryTool.js)
- Sandbox security for safe execution

**Hardware**: Apple Silicon M1 Pro 32GB
- Primary Model: `mistralai/devstral-small-2507` (coding-optimized)
- Local execution via LM Studio
- MLX-optimized performance

## 🚀 Future Development Mission

### Phase 1: Research & Planning (START HERE)

**CRITICAL**: No implementation until research is complete!

**You must thoroughly investigate:**

#### 1. Current Architecture Deep Dive
- [ ] Explore `/gemini-cli-masters-core/dist/src/tools/` - All tool implementations
- [ ] Study tool registry and dynamic loading mechanisms
- [ ] Understand memory system (memoryTool.js) capabilities
- [ ] Map existing MCP integration (mcp-client.js, mcp-tool.js)
- [ ] Analyze content generator and adapter patterns

#### 2. MCP Ecosystem Research
- [ ] Review Model Context Protocol specification
- [ ] Identify available MCP servers (official & community)
- [ ] Study integration patterns for external services
- [ ] Understand security and sandboxing requirements
- [ ] Evaluate local vs remote MCP deployment options

#### 3. RAG Implementation Strategy
- [ ] Research vector database options for local deployment
  - ChromaDB, FAISS, Qdrant, etc.
- [ ] Document embedding strategies for local models
- [ ] Study retrieval patterns for agent workflows
- [ ] Analyze integration with existing file operations
- [ ] Benchmark performance on Apple Silicon

#### 4. Web Crawling & Research
- [ ] Evaluate current web-fetch.js and web-search.js
- [ ] Study autonomous crawling patterns and frameworks
- [ ] Research content extraction and processing
- [ ] Understand rate limiting and ethical considerations
- [ ] Design integration with memory and RAG systems

#### 5. Agent Architecture Patterns
- [ ] Study ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) pattern
- [ ] Research Chain-of-Thought for complex tasks
- [ ] Analyze tool selection and orchestration strategies
- [ ] Study error handling and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Review multi-step planning and execution patterns
